## UX
### Strategy


#### Vision
<em>The Breast Review</em> is an educational tool to increase the knowledge and awareness surrounding Breast Cancer. It will consist of a number of separate pages pertaining to different areas of breast cancer awareness such as the risks, the symptoms and some interesting facts. There will also be an interactive quiz for visitors to the website to encourage the cementing of knowledge through an activity. On the home page there will be a video showing how to check for breast cancer and real life stories of journey's from people who have been affected by breast cancer - both men and women.

Despite breast cancer being one of the most well researched and known-about cancers, there are still a massive amount of breast cancer related deaths that could have been prevented if it were for early detection and education. Our hope for this website is to have a quick, easy and informative resource for anybody who would like to learn more about how to detect breast cancers.

The graphic below shows all of the potential pages and the content within that we could add to this website, some of these will be added and some won't - this will be talked about more in-depth in the FEasibility/Importance section of the README.

#### Feasibility vs Importance

TABLE EXPLANATION HERE
The table above has been plotted into a graph (below) to easily visualise the features that will be implemented into the web application and which ones won't be:
<ul>
    <li>The features in the pink section will be implemented</li>
    <li>The features in the grey section could be implemented at a later date but aren't necessary right now</li>
    <li>The features in the turquoise section will not be implemented as it would be unwise to focus on these features until a later date</li>
</ul>

### Project Creation
This project was created on GitHub and Edited in GitPod by carrying out the following:
<ol>
    <li>A new repository was created using 'Code-Instutute-Org/gitpod-full-template'</li>
    <li>A meaningful name was given to the new repository and 'Create Repository' was selected</li>
    <li>The repository was then opened on GitHub by clicking the 'Gitpod' button to build the GitPod workspace which would allow us to build and edit the code used to make the <em>[Project Name]</em> website/application</li>
    <li>Version control was used throughout the project using the following commands in the terminal using Bash
        <ul>
            <li>git pull origin main - to pull the latest updated files from the main branch to the local repository</li>
            <li>git checkout -b "branch name" - to move to a new branch off the main branch</li>
            <li>git add . <strong>OR</strong> git add "file name" - to stage the changes and get them ready for being committed to the local repo.</li> 
            <li>git commit -m "Description of the update" - to save the change and commit the change to the local repo</li>
            <li>git push origin "branch name" - to push all committed shanges to the GitHub repo associated with the GitPod workspace</li>
            <li>The pushed changes were then reviewed by fellow collaborator(s) and merged with the main branch</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

### Project Deployment

### Local Deployment
There are many ways to deploy the project locally on your own device. The ways we will explain here are: Forking, Cloning, GitHub Desktop and Zip Exctraction, the steps in these processes are outlined below:

#### Forking the GitHub repo
If you want to make changes to the repo without affecting it, you can make a copy of it by 'Forking' it. This will make sure that the original repo remains unchanged.
<ol>
    <li>Log in to your GitHub account</li>
    <li>Navigate to the repository <a href="#"><strong>HERE</strong></a></li>
    <li>Select the 'Fork' button in the top right corner of the page (under your account image)</li>
    <li>The repo has now been copied into your own repos and you can work on it in your chosen IDE</li>
    <li>If you have any suggestions to make regards to the code to make the site better, you can put in a pull request</li>
    <li>If you want to create a web-app from the repo please follow the instructions in "Project Deployment"</li>
</ol>

#### Cloning the repo with GitPod
<ol>
    <li>Log in to your GitHub account</li>
    <li>Navigate to the Repository <a href="#"><strong>HERE</strong></a></li>
    <li>Select the 'Code' button above the file list on the right had side</li>
    <li>Ensure HTTPS is selected and click the clipboard on the right of the URL to copy it</li>
    <li>Open a new workspace in GitPod</li>
    <li>In the bash terminal type 'git clone [copy url here from step 4]'</li>
    <li>Press enter - the IDE will clone and download the repo</li>
    <li>You can then type 'python3 -m http.server' to host the website locally - this will not run the python file, only allow you to check how the web-app looks.</li>
    <li>If you want to create a web-app from the repo please follow the instructions in "Project Deployment"</li>
</ol>

#### Github Desktop
<ol>
    <li>Log in to your GitHub account</li>
    <li>Navigate to the Repository <a href="#"><strong>HERE</strong></a></li>
    <li>Select the 'Code' button above the file list on the right had side</li>
    <li>Select 'Open with GitHub Desktop'</li>
    <li>If you haven't already installed GitHub desktop application - you will need to follow the relevant steps to do this</li>
    <li>The repo will then be copied locally onto your machine</li>
    <li>If you want to create a web-app from the repo please follow the instructions in "Project Deployment"</li>
</ol>

#### Download and extract the zip directly from GitHub
<ol>
    <li>Log in to your GitHub account</li>
    <li>Navigate to the Repository <a href="#"><strong>HERE</strong></a></li>
    <li>Select the 'Code' button above the file list on the right had side</li>
    <li>Select 'Download Zip'</li>
    <li>Once you have the Zip downloaded, open it with your prefered file decompression software</li>
    <li>You can then drag and drop the files from the folder into your chosen IDE or view/edit them on your local machine</li>
    <li>If you want to create a web-app from the repo please follow the instructions in "Project Deployment"</li>
</ol>
