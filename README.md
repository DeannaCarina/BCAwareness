## Introduction
The Breast Review website covers some educative information on breast cancer awareness. The steps to take in examining your breasts, how often the breasts should be examine, risks factors associated with breast cancers and why early detection can save lives.
<br>
The World Health Organisation (WHO) Objectives is to reduce global breast cancer mortality by 2.5% per year, thereby averting 2.5 million breast cancer deaths globally between 2020 and 2040. Reducing global breast cancer mortality by 2.5% per year would avert 25% of breast cancer deaths by 2030 and 40% by 2040 among women under 70 years of age. The three pillars toward achieving these objectives are: health promotion for early detection; timely diagnosis; and comprehensive breast cancer management. It is therefore imperative for frequent reviews on the breast for early detection. 
<br>
We created this website with HTML and CSS with the use of other technologies.
There are also contact links at the bottom of all pages with other resourceful links/sites.

## UX
### Strategy


#### Vision
<em>The Breast Review</em> is an educational tool to increase the knowledge and awareness surrounding Breast Cancer. It will consist of a number of separate pages pertaining to different areas of breast cancer awareness such as the risks, the symptoms and some interesting facts. There will also be an interactive quiz for visitors to the website to encourage the cementing of knowledge through an activity. On the home page there will be a video showing how to check for breast cancer and real life stories of journey's from people who have been affected by breast cancer - both men and women.

Despite breast cancer being one of the most well researched and known-about cancers, there are still a massive amount of breast cancer related deaths that could have been prevented if it were for early detection and education. Our hope for this website is to have a quick, easy and informative resource for anybody who would like to learn more about how to detect breast cancers.

The graphic below shows all of the potential pages and the content within that we could add to this website, some of these will be added and some won't - this will be talked about more in-depth in the FEasibility/Importance section of the README.<br>
<img src="assets/readmeimages/pageplan.png" width="600px">

#### Aims
<ol>
    <li>To be a safe non-judgemental environment for anybody affected by breast cancer to learn more about the pathology</li>
    <li>To be a highly user intuitive application for all users</li>
    <li>To be highly accessible in terms of colour scheme and contrast to cater for the needs of those with sensory needs</li>
    <li>To be a learning tool for everybody that visits the site</li>
    <li>To be a place for those affected by breast cancer to read other people's experiences and stories</li>
    <li>To be a fun and positive experience when most experiences surrounding breast cancer are scary and upsetting</li>
    <li>To be a stepping stone for individuals who want to learn more by supplying further reading with external links</li>
</ol>

#### Target Audience
<ol>
    <ul>Everybody</ul>
    <ul>Although the majority of those who develop breast cancer are in the female over 50 demographic, the disease itself affects everybody, whether that's someone we know that has suffered from it, someone that has been told they're more at risk, or someone that has just had thoughts surrounding it. This web application is for all of those people and everyone in between. Cancer doesn't discriminate, and neither do we.</ul>
</ol>

#### User Stories
As a new and returning user I want to:
<ol>
    <li>Know the purpose of the website as soon as I navigate to the home/landing page</li>
    <li>Navigate the website quickly and effectively</li>
    <li>Find everything in the website that I need to find with ease</li>
    <li>Have visual aids and obvious calls to action throughout the site to aid in user intuitiveness</li>
    <li>Have up to date and relatable stroies from individuals affected by breast cancer</li>
    <li>Have a pleasant experience when visiting the site and get the facts surrounding breast cancer</li>
</ol>

        <td>Sum of Importance:<br> 34</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
</table>
As we can see from the table above, the importance is higher than the viability, which which means that we may run into some problems during the implementation of the web-app if we were to implement all of these features. There are things that we would like to implement but would not have the means or knowledge or time to implement them. Therefore the web-app will take a more basic layout, and we will work within the confines of our limitations to acheive the main goals we have set.

The table above has been plotted into a graph (below) to easily visualise the features that will be implemented into the web application and which ones won't be:
<ul>
    <li>The features in the pink section will be implemented</li>
    <li>The features in the grey section could be implemented at a later date but aren't necessary right now</li>
    <li>The features in the turquoise section will not be implemented as it would be unwise to focus on these features until a later date</li>
</ul>

### Scope

We have chosen to design and implement our web-application based on the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) model. This allows us to create a fully functioning web-app with the least amount of content while still having the website functionable for users. This allows us to see if the website has a positive reaction before more development work takes place (for example implementing features that we have chosen to leave out for the moment). 

The MVP model will:
<ul>
    <li>Create a clear website with enough content for the customers wants and needs to be fulfilled without having dedicated too much time to the project itself</li>
    <li>Allow us to work within the scope of our abilitiy while also allowing us to challenge ourselves</li>
    <li>Result in a website with medium levels of UX without dedicating too much time to the project</li>
    <li>Result in a basic yet easy to use and functional website for site visitors</li>
</ul>
While following the MVP model, to meet the user and developer goals, our website will include:
<ul>
    <li>A self-designed logo on all pages as assurance to the customer we are a trusted resource with our own identity</li>
    <li>A nav-bar on all pages to be able to navigate to separate pages on the website</li>
    <li>Links to associalted social media on all pages within the footer</li>
    <li>A medium amount of visual content including videos as an alternative way for users to learn about breast cancer</li>
    <li>A small web-quiz for users to interact with as an alternative way of learning about breast cancer</li>
</ul>

### Structure

We have chosen to carry out a very basic linear method of design for this website, and have a layout that is both logical and easy to understand for any user that visits the site. By having multiple page we can separate quite important information into logical sections to make it easier for the user to find what they are looking for. The navigation bar at the top of all of the pages allows the user to easily navigate to the page of the website they are most interested in.

### Project Creation
This project was created on GitHub and Edited in GitPod by carrying out the following:
<ol>
    <li>A new repository was created using 'Code-Instutute-Org/gitpod-full-template'</li>
    <li>A meaningful name was given to the new repository and 'Create Repository' was selected</li>
    <li>The repository was then opened on GitHub by clicking the 'Gitpod' button to build the GitPod workspace which would allow us to build and edit the code used to make the <em>[Project Name]</em> website/application</li>
    <li>Version control was used throughout the project using the following commands in the terminal using Bash
        <ul>
            <li>git pull origin main - to pull the latest updated files from the main branch to the local repository</li>
            <li>git checkout -b "branch name" - to move to a new branch off the main branch</li>
            <li>git add . <strong>OR</strong> git add "file name" - to stage the changes and get them ready for being committed to the local repo.</li> 
            <li>git commit -m "Description of the update" - to save the change and commit the change to the local repo</li>
            <li>git push origin "branch name" - to push all committed shanges to the GitHub repo associated with the GitPod workspace</li>
            <li>The pushed changes were then reviewed by fellow collaborator(s) and merged with the main branch</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

### Project Deployment

### Local Deployment
There are many ways to deploy the project locally on your own device. The ways we will explain here are: Forking, Cloning, GitHub Desktop and Zip Exctraction, the steps in these processes are outlined below:

#### Forking the GitHub repo
If you want to make changes to the repo without affecting it, you can make a copy of it by 'Forking' it. This will make sure that the original repo remains unchanged.
<ol>
    <li>Log in to your GitHub account</li>
    <li>Navigate to the repository <a href="#"><strong>HERE</strong></a></li>
    <li>Select the 'Fork' button in the top right corner of the page (under your account image)</li>
    <li>The repo has now been copied into your own repos and you can work on it in your chosen IDE</li>
    <li>If you have any suggestions to make regards to the code to make the site better, you can put in a pull request</li>
    <li>If you want to create a web-app from the repo please follow the instructions in "Project Deployment"</li>
</ol>

#### Cloning the repo with GitPod
<ol>
    <li>Log in to your GitHub account</li>
    <li>Navigate to the Repository <a href="#"><strong>HERE</strong></a></li>
    <li>Select the 'Code' button above the file list on the right had side</li>
    <li>Ensure HTTPS is selected and click the clipboard on the right of the URL to copy it</li>
    <li>Open a new workspace in GitPod</li>
    <li>In the bash terminal type 'git clone [copy url here from step 4]'</li>
    <li>Press enter - the IDE will clone and download the repo</li>
    <li>You can then type 'python3 -m http.server' to host the website locally - this will not run the python file, only allow you to check how the web-app looks.</li>
    <li>If you want to create a web-app from the repo please follow the instructions in "Project Deployment"</li>
</ol>

#### Github Desktop
<ol>
    <li>Log in to your GitHub account</li>
    <li>Navigate to the Repository <a href="#"><strong>HERE</strong></a></li>
    <li>Select the 'Code' button above the file list on the right had side</li>
    <li>Select 'Open with GitHub Desktop'</li>
    <li>If you haven't already installed GitHub desktop application - you will need to follow the relevant steps to do this</li>
    <li>The repo will then be copied locally onto your machine</li>
    <li>If you want to create a web-app from the repo please follow the instructions in "Project Deployment"</li>
</ol>

#### Download and extract the zip directly from GitHub
<ol>
    <li>Log in to your GitHub account</li>
    <li>Navigate to the Repository <a href="#"><strong>HERE</strong></a></li>
    <li>Select the 'Code' button above the file list on the right had side</li>
    <li>Select 'Download Zip'</li>
    <li>Once you have the Zip downloaded, open it with your prefered file decompression software</li>
    <li>You can then drag and drop the files from the folder into your chosen IDE or view/edit them on your local machine</li>
    <li>If you want to create a web-app from the repo please follow the instructions in "Project Deployment"</li>
</ol>
