                    <h2>What is breast cancer?</h2>
                    <p>Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. There are different kinds of breast cancer. The kind of breast cancer depends on which cells in the breast turn into cancer.</p>
                    <p>Breast cancer can begin in different parts of the breast. A breast is made up of three main parts: lobules, ducts, and connective tissue. The lobules are the glands that produce milk. The ducts are tubes that carry milk to the nipple. The connective tissue (which consists of fibrous and fatty tissue) surrounds and holds everything together. Most breast cancers begin in the ducts or lobules.</p>
                    <p>Breast cancer can spread outside the breast through blood vessels and lymph vessels. When breast cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it is said to have metastasized.</p>

            <h3>8 Interesting Facts about Breast Cancer</h3>
            <button class="accordion">Pets can get breast cancer too</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Breast cancer occurs in both dogs and cats; it tends to be far more aggressive in cats. It is not
                    only humans who suffer from breast cancer, some animals do too. It is more common in dogs than cats,
                    but tends to be more aggressive in cats than dogs.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Wasp dung was used as a treatment for breast cancer</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Insect faeces featured heavily in ancient remedies for breast cancer. An Egyptian papyrus recommended
                    a mixture of cow’s brain and wasp dung to be applied to breast tumours for four days. Insect faeces
                    were still considered one of the most advanced treatments for breast cancer up until the Middle
                    Ages. Thankfully, treatments have advanced a great deal since then.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Breast cancer has been called the “nun’s disease”</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Lifelong nuns, like all women who never have children, are at an increased risk of dying from breast,
                    ovarian and uterine cancers, compared with mothers. A woman's risk of getting these cancers
                    increases with the number of menstrual cycles she experiences.</p>

            <button class="accordion">The first record of a mastectomy for breast cancer</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The first record of a breast mastectomy was in A.D. 548 on Theodora, Empress of Byzantine.
                    Significant progress in our understanding and treatment of breast cancer in recent decades has seen
                    a dramatic reduction in the use of ‘radical’ mastectomy (where the breast, underlying chest muscle
                    and lymph nodes are removed), which was the standard surgical approach to breast cancer right up
                    until the 1960s. </p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Men get breast cancer too.</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>A man’s lifetime risk of breast cancer is about 1 in 1,000. Many people do not realise that men have
                    breast tissue and that they can develop breast cancer. But breast cancer is less common in men
                    because their breast duct cells are less developed than those of women and because they normally
                    have lower levels of female hormones that affect the growth of breast cells.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Shift work may increase risk of breast cancer</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The International Agency for Research on Cancer recently concluded that women who worked night shifts
                    for 30 years or more were twice as likely to develop breast cancer. However, women who work nights
                    are advised not to panic. It’s worth noting that no link was found between higher breast cancer risk
                    and periods of night work which were shorter than 30 years.</p>

            <button class="accordion">More common in the left breast than the right</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The left breast is 5 - 10% more likely to develop cancer than the right breast. The left side of the
                    body is also roughly 5% more prone to melanoma (a type of skin cancer). Nobody is exactly sure why
                    this is.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">80% survival rate (in developed countries)</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Huge progress has been made in recent years in breast cancer. In fact, breast cancer management
                    across risk assessment, prevention, surgery, radiation, and other treatment, has changed
                    dramatically. Death rates from breast cancer in more developed countries have been declining in
                    recent years, and now survival rates are 80% or over in countries like the US, Sweden and Japan.
                    However, survival rates remain below 40% in low-income countries.</p>
