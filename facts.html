                        <h2>What is breast cancer?</h2>
                        <p>Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. There are
                            different kinds of breast cancer. The kind of breast cancer depends on which cells in
                            the breast turn into cancer.</p>
                        <p>Breast cancer can begin in different parts of the breast. A breast is made up of three
                            main parts: lobules, ducts, and connective tissue. The lobules are the glands that
                            produce milk. The ducts are tubes that carry milk to the nipple. The connective tissue
                            (which consists of fibrous and fatty tissue) surrounds and holds everything together.
                            Most breast cancers begin in the ducts or lobules.</p>
                        <p>Breast cancer can spread outside the breast through blood vessels and lymph vessels. When
                            breast cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it is said to have metastasized.</p>

                        <p>Insect faeces featured heavily in ancient remedies for breast cancer. An Egyptian

                            Significant progress in our understanding and treatment of breast cancer in recent

                            has
                            seen

                            right up

                            breast tissue and that they can develop breast cancer. But breast cancer is less
                            common in
                            men
                            because their breast duct cells are less developed than those of women and because
                            they
                            normally
                            have lower levels of female hormones that affect the growth of breast cells.</p>

                            age

                        <p>Most people diagnosed with breast cancer have no known family history. Only about
                            5–10% of
                            breast
                            cancers are believed to be hereditary, meaning they’re caused by abnormal changes
                            (or
                            mutations)
                            in certain genes passed from parent to child. The vast majority of people who get
                            breast
                            cancer
                            have no family history, suggesting that other factors must be at work, such as
                            environment
                            and
                            lifestyle. Still, if you have a strong family history of breast cancer on either

                            mother’s

                            seriously. If

                            are one or more cases of breast cancer in close blood relatives, especially before
                            age 50,
                            and/or other cancers such as ovarian and prostate cancer in your family, share this
                            information

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p> From time to time, media coverage and the internet have fueled myths that wearing a
                            bra can
                            increase breast cancer risk. The theory was that wearing a bra — especially an
                            underwire
                            style —
                            could restrict the flow of lymph fluid out of the breast, causing toxic substances
                            to build
                            up
                            in the tissue. However, there is no evidence to support this claim. A <a

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in the UK. Most women diagnosed with
                            breast
                            cancer are over the age of 50, but younger women can also get breast cancer. About 1
                            in 8
                            women
                            are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. There's a good chance of
                            recovery if
                            it's detected at an early stage. For this reason, it's vital that women check their
                            breasts
                            regularly for any changes and always have any changes examined by a GP.</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Survival of breast cancer for at least 5 years after diagnosis ranges from more than
                            90% in
                            high-income countries, to 66% in India and 40% in South Africa. In 2020, there were
                            2.3
                            million
                            women worldwide diagnosed with breast cancer and 685 000 deaths globally. As of the
                            end of
                            2020,
                            there were 7.8 million women alive who were diagnosed with breast cancer in the past
                            5
                            years,

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>One to three percent of survivors develop a second cancer different from the
                            originally
                            treated
                            cancer. The level of risk is small, and greater numbers of survivors are living
                            longer due
                            to
                            improvements in treatment. However, even thinking about the possibility of having a
                            second
                            cancer can be stressful. Current research shows that cancer survivors in general
                            have an
                            increased chance of developing cancer compared to people of the same age and gender

                            not
                            had cancer. This means that it is even more important for cancer survivors to be
                            aware of
                            the
                            risk factors for second cancers and maintain good follow-up health care.</p>

                    <button class="accordion">How often should I be examining myself?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Give yourself a breast self-exam once a month. Look for any changes in breast tissue,
                            such as
                            changes in size, feeling a palpable lump, dimpling or puckering of the breast,
                            inversion of
                            the
                            nipple, redness or scaliness of the breast skin, redness or scaliness of the
                            nipple/areola
                            area,
                            or discharge of secretions from the nipple.

                            If you discover a persistent lump in your breast or any changes, it is very
                            important that
                            you
                            see a physician immediately. Though 8 out of 10 lumps are benign, all require
                            evaluation to
                            confirm that they are not cancerous.

                            Women should perform their breast self exam 7-10 days after their menstrual period
                            starts
                            which
                            is also when their breasts are the least tender and lumpy. If they are no longer
                            menstruating,
                            then she should select the same day of the month (first of the month for example)
                            and mark
                            it on
                            the calendar to remind herself when to perform this self exam. What to look for is a
                            change
                            from
                            last month’s exam to this month’s exam. It is not unusual to have lumpy or bumpy
                            breasts.

                            All women should know the geography of their own breasts. If having trouble
                            remembering,
                            draw a
                            diagram of where the lumps, bumps, grooves, and other findings are felt so that this
                            can be
                            used
                            as a reminder from month to month. There is no added value in doing breast self
                            exams more
                            often
                            than monthly. Also the findings may be different as well, in relationship to where a
                            woman
                            is in
                            her menstrual cycle.</p>

                        <p>Talk! Chat online! Family support is important, but not everyone is lucky enough to
                            have that
                            and
                            besides, sometimes family can also be very annoying! Find support on Facebook,
                            perhaps
                            through a
                            formal support group, or counselling. Waiting is one of the worst ordeals you will

                            through on

                            message boards throughout the Internet never close. The web works 24 hours a day, 7

                            week,
                            and so does the telephone.

                            Sometimes, talk isn't enough. You shouldn't feel surprised if you feel anxious or
                            depressed;
                            you

                            to
